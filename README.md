This is a Web Application for Sorting Visualizer   
You can visit here https://sherwindavis.github.io/sorting-visualizer/    
## Objective
This project is made to let students or the educators understand how these algorithms work and through this project you will also get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.   
   
   With an aim to facilitate the understanding, analysis and design of sorting algorithms, a tool for their visualization called ViSA is presented. Using ViSA, students are guided in the learning process by a detailed step-by-step explanation.

## Current supported Algorithms.   
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort   
## Upcoming Features
- Color Themes
- Pathfinding Algorithms
- More Sorting Algorithms
- Mobile first design
- Various other customizations
- Custom Array input
- UI Rework using ReactJS
- Various bug fixes and optimizations.
